	<h1>SURVIV.IO</h1>
		<p>Surviv.io is a 2 dimensional top down battle royale game that was launched in October 2017 by Nick (/u/nick_dev on Reddit) and Justin (/u/survivio on Reddit). Initially, the game was only available to play solo and had no sound. However, sound was added in patch 0.1.0 on November 14, 2017. The duo game-mode was added in patch 0.2.0 on January 17, 2018. Additional patches have introduced new <b>Weapons, Game Modes, Ammunition, Buildings, and more.</b> The squads game mode was added on the night of March 14, 2018. The team mode came last. As its name suggests, the goal is to survive and be the last one standing on the island.</p>
		<p><h4><b><i>The gameplay mechanics are similar to other battle royale games such as PUBG, DayZ and Fortnite;</i></b> although the game is more closely based off of PUBG. However, the game can be played in any browser as well as on mobile. In addition, it shares many characteristics with other browser-based io battle royale games such as <b>Foes.io, Zombsroyale.io, and Bruh.io.</b></h4></p>
